Use spaces around operators like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`. This is the
**preferred** way, although other styles are possible, as long as it is
applied consistently.

    # preferred

    1 + 2 * 4

    # also okay

    1+2*4

While this is not necessarily a concern for the correctness of your code,
you should use a consistent style throughout your codebase.
