The ABC size describes a metric based on assignments, branches and conditions.

A high ABC size is a hint that a function might be doing "more" than it
should.

As always: Take any metric with a grain of salt. Since this one was originally
introduced for C, C++ and Java, we still have to see whether or not this can
be a useful metric in a declarative language like Elixir.
