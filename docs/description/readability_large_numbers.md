Numbers can contain underscores for readability purposes.
These do not affect the value of the number, but can help read large numbers
more easily.

    141592654 # how large is this number?

    141_592_654 # ah, it's in the hundreds of millions!

Like all `Readability` issues, this one is not a technical concern.
But you can improve the odds of others reading and liking your code by making
it easier to follow.
