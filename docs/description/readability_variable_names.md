Variable names are always written in snake_case in Elixir.

    # snake_case:

    incoming_result = handle_incoming_message(message)

    # not snake_case

    incomingResult = handle_incoming_message(message)

Like all `Readability` issues, this one is not a technical concern.
But you can improve the odds of others reading and liking your code by making
it easier to follow.
