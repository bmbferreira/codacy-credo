Tabs should be used consistently.

NOTE: This check does not verify the indentation depth, but checks whether
or not soft/hard tabs are used consistently across all source files.

It is very common to use 2 spaces wide soft-tabs, but that is not a strict
requirement and you can use hard-tabs if you like that better.

While this is not necessarily a concern for the correctness of your code,
you should use a consistent style throughout your codebase.
