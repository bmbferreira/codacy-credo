FIXME comments are used to indicate places where source code needs fixing.

Example:

    # FIXME: this does no longer work, research new API url
    defp fun do
      # ...
    end

The premise here is that FIXME should indeed be fixed as soon as possible and
are therefore reported by Credo.

Like all `Software Design` issues, this is just advice and might not be
applicable to your project/situation.
