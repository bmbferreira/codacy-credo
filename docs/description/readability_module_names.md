Module names are always written in PascalCase in Elixir.

    # PascalCase

    defmodule MyApp.WebSearchController do
      # ...
    end

    # not PascalCase

    defmodule MyApp.Web_searchController do
      # ...
    end

Like all `Readability` issues, this one is not a technical concern.
But you can improve the odds of other reading and liking your code by making
it easier to follow.
