TODO comments are used to remind yourself of source code related things.

Example:

    # TODO: move this to a Helper module
    defp fun do
      # ...
    end

The premise here is that TODO should be dealt with in the near future and
are therefore reported by Credo.

Like all `Software Design` issues, this is just advice and might not be
applicable to your project/situation.
